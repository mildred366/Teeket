## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind Css
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) - Login authenticator
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

During the course of this bootcamp, I have learnt a whole lot. This project particularly taught me to get my balance in Tailwind Css and the React Js framework. I particularly want to bask in my confidence with using components to make work easier and also how I can now user react router Dom to navigate pages. 
The Tailwind aspect of this project showed me how use breakpoints appropriately and how to style components easily with less rules making room for a very neat code base.

Not to forget the firebase and toastify aspect, I love how I was able to use toastify to tell users that their login was successful and how I leveraged firebase to see how much interaction my web application has.


### Continued development

Subsequently, I will like to improve this application further and enable a payment portal where users can shop for their tickets.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me in understanding React hooks. I really liked their pattern of breaking down complex topics into bits.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - This is for all developers I suppose.
